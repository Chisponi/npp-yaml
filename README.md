## Sublime-like YAML syntax highlighting for Notepad++

The standard dark Monokai theme for Notepad++ does not have YAML syntax highlighting.

The github-based dark Darcula theme has it, but not in my favorite "Sublime"-like colors.

So i changed the Darcula theme's YAML highlighting to resemble the "Sublime"-like colors and font as much as possible.

Based on gogo2's Darcula theme at:

## Installation

Copy file Darcula.xml to C:/Users/%USERNAME%/AppData/Roaming/Notepad++/themes directory.
